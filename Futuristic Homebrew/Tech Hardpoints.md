_Tactical Visor_  
As a bonus action, the Commando marks a target with his tactical visor. The marked target takes an additional `1d6` damage from the Commando's attacks. The Commando can only have one marked target at a time. Additonally, the visor mitigates sight-based effects like smoke or stealth, and those effects will confer no disadvantage to the Commando's attacks while the target remains marked.
