### Ezra Holmion's Vestments
> Many years ago Ezra Holmion stood as the patriarch of the family, and the principle founder of the Holmion dynasty. A product of Avernus' Al'Amin, Ezra's magical prowess stood as a beacon amongst his peers. He was one of the few masters of magic who would go on to usher in the magical renassance of the third era, and cement the Human Kingdoms of the Pontar Valley as the new budding empire of the Western Continent - a reign which would last for decades after Ezra's death.

### The Manchuak
> This short, curved dagger was found in the posession of the infamous bounty hunter, Don Chafe, although the strange runic markings along its blade and hilt hint at more historic origins. Its creator has long since been unknown, and perhaps the knowledge died with the bounty hunter. How the weapon ended up in the posession of the awakened spider, Khalaxx, is another mystery.

| Features | |
|----:|----|
| Type | Dagger + 1 |
| Attunement | Using The Manchuak, the wielder much take a life for no other motivation than the gold reward, remaining in total indifference to the killing. Afterwards, the wielder must spend the night using his hard earned bounty to celebrate. In the fevered, alcohol fueled dreams following the celebration, the weapon's potential will be made clear.  |
| Shadowstep [A] | As part of his attack, the wielder can trigger the Manchuak's special ability to shadowstep to a visible target up to 90 feet away, striking with advantage. This ability is reset every time the wielder kills a humanoid with The Manchuak. |

### Lesomir (+1 Longsword)
This weapon is as elegant as it is effective. The hilt is a brilliant gold-bronze and is marked with an ornate triangle symbol. As it meets the blade, the hilt splayes out into winding leaves and vines of bronze, providing the wielder a truly artistic handguard. The blade is a thin, brilliant silver and catches the sullight easily as it bounces off the strange runes carved in the surface. Perhaps there is someone you could find who would give you more history on this blade, and how it ended up here.

History: //TODO

Masterworked Accuracy - once per day, the wielder of the Lesomir can choose to reroll an attack roll and take the higher result.

## Tier 3 (+2)

## Tier 4 (+3)

### Corrupted Vardenfell (Violin, Artifact Attunement)
Prior to attunement:
Vardenfell functions entirely like an ordinary, but elegant violin.

Attunenment: Vardenfell must be awakened for its magical properties to begin to flourish. Eldrazi ichor has awakened this particular version.

Post attunement:
Vardenfell grows with the power of its wielder, becoming more powerful as the character gains levels...

Level 4
At level 4, a large and brilliant lily sprouts from the end of the violin. The lily gives off light as the spell, and if it is destroyed the artifact ceases to function until the lily regrows in 3d4 days. While active, the instrument confers a +1 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws with spells cast using Vardenfell as a focus. Additionally, the instrument allows the wielder to cast Entangle (Druid 1) in addition to his other spells and allows the wielder to cast Plant Growth (Druid 3) once per day.
