### Lesomir (+1 Longsword)
This weapon is as elegant as it is effective. The hilt is a brilliant gold-bronze and is marked with an ornate triangle symbol. As it meets the blade, the hilt splayes out into winding leaves and vines of bronze, providing the wielder a truly artistic handguard. The blade is a thin, brilliant silver and catches the sullight easily as it bounces off the strange runes carved in the surface. Perhaps there is someone you could find who would give you more history on this blade, and how it ended up here.

History: //TODO

Masterworked Accuracy - once per day, the wielder of the Lesomir can choose to reroll an attack roll and take the higher result.

### The Manchuak
> This short, curved dagger was found in the posession of the infamous bounty hunter, Don Chafe, although the strange runic markings along its blade and hilt hint at more historic origins.
