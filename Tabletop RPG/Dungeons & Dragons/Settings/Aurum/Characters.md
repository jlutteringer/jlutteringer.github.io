## Bella Stroud
Bella Stroud is Les Stroud's daughter and apprentice. At an early age, she was afflicted with the same vampiric curse which afflicted Les Stroud. For most of her life, Bella served as an agent of the Shadow Thieves, carrying out her father's wishes no matter how difficult the task.

Les Stroud's betrayl took everyone by suprise, including his own daughter. The pair dueled in the Mechanus as Bella tried to defend what remained of the Shadow Thieves. Bella Stroud was soundly beaten. Les Stroud destroyed her body and left her for dead, rejoining the material plane with the divine essence of Talos in hand. Bella survived, however, managing to escape back to the material plane where she returned to the ancient Stroud home of Volkskaya. It was there, on the verge of death, where Bella took her seat on the Incorrigible Throne, an artifact which resonates necrotic energies of emmence power. It was this energy which kept Bella in a state of undeath, her spirit still bound to her ruined body. The vampiress, unable to move or speak, communicates telepathically with her servants and seeks to perform a ritual which can bind her spirit to a new form.

After her servant, the vampire Galeen Bale, ambushed and charmed Victor Montague on the road south from Verns to Seabide, Bella Stroud took up the now defunct mantle of the Shadow Thieves, seeking to transform the organization into an agent for her own will.
