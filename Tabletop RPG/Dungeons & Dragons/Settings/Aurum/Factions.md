# Factions

This is a listing of some various factions that will be encountered in the world, and some common knowledge about each of them.

## Orlesian Rose
The Orleasian Rose is the name given to the lawmaking body which governs the Republic. Each protectorate sends several representatives base on its size, and Orleans elecets a Chancellor who provides over the council. Togther, the council will vote to make laws, where the Chancellor will both preside over this process and oversee their execution. Ever since the Ontillan rebellion, the current Chancellor, Gerard Tullius, has retained emergency powers and directly controls most areas of the Republic's central government.

## Republic Legions
The Republican Guard is the name given to the Republic's primary fighing force. Mostly lead by Orlesian nobles, the Guard both functions as a city watch in the capital as well as other Orleasian cities and a proper war fighting ground force.

## Republic Marines
The Marines as an organization run the Republic's navy. They have a heavy presence around Seabide and the Alluvian Gulf region due to its trade promince and proximity to the large military port of Willhelm.

## Order of the Vigilant Eye
The Order of the Vigilant Eyes was formed well before the creation of the Republic. In fact, the origins of the Vigilant Eyes are truely unknown as they predate written history itself in the region. The Order's legend claims that it was formed to battle a powerful cosmic enemy in a time that predates the formation of Kingdoms and armies, and that the patron deity of the Order, Helm, was slain in a battle for the material plane on a cosmic scale, the blood of his avatar splling over the Redmont plains fertlizing the region for generation to come. Many people, even those in the Order, acknowledge that these are merely tales designed to highlight the true purpose of the order - protecting mankind from the desctruction wrought by malicious outsiders. Since the formation of the Republic, the Order has taken a more active role in the military, often serving as officers in the Republican Guard, or leading special task forces. Recently, there has been a schism within the Order, as its Elders push against the military involvement and try to keep the Order focused on its 'true' goals.

## Cowled Wizards
Mostly made up of high ranking mages from the Arcane Circle in Orleans, the Cowled Wizards were formed shortly after the creation of the Republic as the primary means to enforce the arcane spellcasting restrictions. During the Sundering war, arcane magic devastated both sides and after its conclusion the Orlesian Rose outlawed public arcane magic outside of Orleans. The Cowled Wizards have locations in most large cities, but are headquartered in Vern. Additionally, the magical prison of Spellhold sits in Antion, and is used to house magical deviants.

## Blackwatch Mercenaries
The Blackwatch Mercenaries are the muscle behind the Cowled Wizards. Really nothing more than hired blades, the Blackwatch forces work jobs for the Cowled Wizards exclusively. Many of the initial members were part of the Republican Guard but lately the Blackwatch have been known to resort to more unscrupulous methods to get their mark.

## Shadow Thieves
The Shadow Thieves are one of the largest criminal organizations in the Realm. Little is known about the organization itself, but their reach extends to almost any city in the Republic. The Shadow Thieves tend to be more numerous along the coast, and have been known to operate captured Republic frigates for transporting operatives and smuggling runs. Unlike common thieves and pirates, the Shadow Thieves prefer political espionage, information gathering, smuggling contraband, and targeted assassinations over outright theft and harassing the local populace. This has somewhat protected the organization from more aggressive attempts to crack down on organized crime by the Republican Guard.

## The Cult of the Unseeing Eye

## The Branded
The Branded are a rebel organization on Antion who oppose the Republic's presence there and want to see Antion returned to an independent city state. They are mostly natives to Antion, and believe that the citizens of Antion should be in control of its own desity. Members are typically initiated with a circular branding around the wrist. The Branded get their name from an insurgent group that fought off Orleaian troops during the civil war, and kept Antion independent until the close of the civil war, when it was forced to submit to the Republic under the surrender of the Alluivan Gulf region. Since the surrender, many of the original Branded were imprisoned or executed, but it is rumored that their leader. Brant Eiseman, was one of the original freedom fighters and clashed openly with Orlesian soldiers. In the last 15 years, the Branded have worked to politically undermine the current Republic-appointed govoner, and to disrupt Republic operations without direct conflict. Lately, however, they have been in open conflict with the Blackfist pirates who have taken defacto control of most of the city in order to protect the general populace, and have been protesting the Republic's lack of protection. The populace generally views the Branded as protectors of the people, but reckless.

## Council of Faceless Lords
The Council of Faceless Lords rules Avernus in cooperation with the Avernian High Council. The group of eight is nominated by the strongest political houses in Taris and meets regularly. The identity of each member is only known to a select few, and each member hides his identity during the meeting.
