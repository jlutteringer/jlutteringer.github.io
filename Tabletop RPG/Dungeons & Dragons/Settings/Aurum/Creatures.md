#### Stormlord's Heart

## The Eldrazi

### Pawn of Ulamog
> The creature before you bears little remnant of it's humanity. Appearing as a discheveld man in torn or tattered clothing, it suffers from horrific deformities which cover the body. Bits of bone that have grown into sharp points extrude from the skin at the joints, and its hands and mouth more closely resemble monstrous claws and fangs. A large, pulsing creature is fused into the man's spine, it's claws digging deeply into the the man's exposed flesh.

### Spawn of Ulamog
> It was a twisted, vaguely humanoid creature which crawled towards you, almost writhing in it's movements. It's hairless body bore a green, slimy hue, and it's head was featureless save for a wide, circular mouth with dagger-like teeth. The creature crawled along the ground with suprising dexterity, propelled by four powerful clawed arms. It's legs were missshapen and useless, deformed appendages which dragged behind the creature. A mockery of humanity, this alien horror almost defies description.

### Manipulator
> This creature is an agile spawn of the Eldrazi, about the size of a small dog. Its body is a featurless hexagonal prisim, grayish-red in color and covered in insectoid chitin plates. Six segmented legs sprout from the base and are accompanied by a long, barbed tail, much like that of a scorpion.

| Conscription | On a successful barbed tail attack against an incapacitated opponent, the manipulator can, as a bouns action, conscript its target to join the Eldrazi hivemind. The target makes a DC 10 constitution saving throw, on a success it takes 5d6 damage as the Manipulator tries to burrow into its spine, on a failed save the Manipulator latches onto the targets spine. For every turn the Manipulator is attached, the target must make a DC 15 Wisdom save. Upon death or a failed save, the target becomes a pawn of the Eldrazi. |
| Speed | 40 |

### Eldrazi Prowler
> Like a great many of the Eldrazi, this creature is a combination of vaguely humanoid characteristics with a truely alien frame. The creature sprints at great speed, propelled by six muscular hand-like legs which unite at a plated abdomen that makes up the majority of the creature's body. In its front, another six clawed hands sprout from it's chest, an undeniably human feature which makes the beast all the more unsettling. Like many of these Eldritch horrors, the beast bears a faceless head which scans back and fourth, surveying the landscape through some unexplainable means. Six long and muscular tentacles extrude from the creature's back, writing togther in a wriggling mass as the thing stalks its prey.
