| The Eldrazi |

Eldrazi Pawns:

Manipulator
	The manipulator is an agile spawn of the Eldrazi, about the size of a small dog. Its body is a featurless hexagonal prisim, grayish-red in color and covered in insectoid chitin plates. Six segmented legs sprout from the base as well as a long barbed tail, much like that of a scorpion.

    Mobile

	Eldrazi Conscription: On a successful barbed tail attack against an incapacitated opponent, the manipulator can, as a bouns action, conscript its target to join the Eldrazi hivemind. The target makes a DC 10 constitution saving throw, on a success it takes 5d6 damage as the Manipulator tries to burrow into its spine, on a failed save the Manipulator latches onto the targets spine. For every turn the Manipulator is attached, the target must make a DC 15 Wisdom save. Upon death or a failed save, the target becomes part of the Eldrazi (as a Pawn of Ulamog).

Pawn of Ulamog
	Pawns of Ulamog are humanoids, or other intelligent creatures that can be affected by Eldrazi Conscription. Conscription grants the target greatly increased strength, stamina, and agility. Conscripted targets can take on a variety of behaviors. With more powerful Eldrazi present, they will always follow the commands of the masters. Without the influence of a stronger Eldrazi, Pawns can become crazed with violence, and attack other creatures and other Pawns with impunity. Some Pawns retain their pesonalities and thoughts, and can instead serve as sleeper agents, futhering the Eldrazi's goals.

Spawn of Ulamog
	Spawns of Ulamog are twisted, vaguely humanoid creatures that excrete from stronger Eldrazi. They are hairless, and have a featureless head except a circular mouth with barbed teeth, accompanied by purpleish-green, slimy skin. Crawling along the ground with four clawed arms and suprising dexterity, the Spawn's legs are missshapen and useless, just deformed appendaged that trail behind it. The Spawn is a mockery of humanity, and prefers to ambush its targets, able to crawl up walls and along cielings.
