# Loghain's Manor
> Loghain's estate was almost modest in comparison to some of the homes in the glass district. A ten foot wall, short and thick, surrounded the perimeter with the occasional guard walking its ramparts. In front, a small gatehouse permitted just enough room for a mounted rider to pass, and was manned by another two guards. Surrounding the estate was a collection of smaller two story townhomes, which almost seemed to nestle up against the manor walls.

> The manor itself sported a striking, modern design, it's surface a brilliant white with squared edges. The building had an open feel, with large windows looking out on the immacuately kept lawn. Before he left for the Sunding War, Loghain planted a small orchard in the south of the property which has matured into tall apple trees that tower over the surrounding pallisade.

One of the suits of armor in this room has a keyhole in the chestpiece. It is fairly obvious, but requires the key in Loghain's master bedroom.

The keyhole which opens this door is much harder to spot. Beneath one of the training dummies, there is a keyhole in the floor which opens a false wall. An astute observer might notice both marks in the floor from the false wall and marks in the floor from the training dummy being moved.

> Oh Mighty Lord, by whom all things are set free, I cast myself utterly into thine arms and place myself unreservedly under thy all powerful protection. Comfort me and deliver me from all of the hindrances and snares of those who wish to harm me, both seen and unseen. 

> Visit justice and vengeance upon those who seek my destruction. Render them powerless and devastated. Direct their malice to return upon them tenfold and to destroy them who would resent my being. 

> Fill my soul with thy invincible power, strengthen me, that I may persevere in my service, and act as an agent of thy works and a vessel of thy will. 

> This I ask in your name, almighty and ineffable Lord who liveth and reigneth forevermore. 
> Ave Satanas
