## Palace Isle
### Fort Bragg
> Constructed from immense blocks of coarse stone, the ramparts of Fort Bragg dwarfed the surrounding homes and buisness, an imposing wall which rose from the city like a mountain. The fort itself was a narrow triangle, coming to a sharp point which ended in the main gatehouse. During normal operation this was the only entrance to and from the palace isle and long lines of civilians gathered at these gates to present proper paperwork. 

> Covered in full plate and wielding long halberds at their sides, the palace guard dutifully managed the checkpoint, keeping a steady flow of civilians through the gate. This whole operation was watched by more soldiers on the ramparts, carefully watching the crowd below. The armed presence was common these days - part of the crown's efforts to strengthen security around the palace.

### Champs-Elysees
> As a structure, the Champs-Elysees is second only to the Palace of the White Opal itself. Streching nearly a mile, this bridge connects the mainland to the palace isle in a single flat strip of polished stone. Like the palace, this structure predates the Orlesians and has long been suspected to be of Elniah construction due to its peculiar style. Despite being of enormous size, the Champs-Elysees has no apparent seams which blemish its brilliant white-marble surface. Instead appears to have been, impossibly, carved from a single block of marble and then somehow placed in its current position. Today mages still speculate as to what sort of magic could produce such an effect, but the secrets of the construction remain lost to history.

> At its highest point, the Champs-Elysees rises seventy feet above the White Sea and offers a dramatic, if not dizzying, view of the Sea's glassy surface from the ramparts. Massive pillars of marble attach at the top and descend down beneath the waves, securing the structure to the deep bedrock below. Although few besides the King and his staff live on the Palace Isle, each day hundreds of nobles and civilians traverse the Champs-Elysees as part of the daily commute and it is not uncommon to see the bridge filled with foot traffic.

### Palace of the White Opal
// TODO

#### Great Hall
> The room is a massive rectangular space, sporting high vaulted cielings with ornately decorated stone work. Its long eastern wall is swallowed by a window which seamlessly fits floor to cieling, giving one a strange sense of vertigo when observing the palace lawns from this gallery. A large, dark-oak dining table dominates the center of the room. Likely able to sit over a hundred guests the table now sports a few modest place settings and one end. The western wall sports opulent paintings of Orleans' dynasty each cronologing the lines of successions from ruler to ruler, ending in a dramatic painting of Radovid Heclair overseeing all six member states of the Republic from the palace lawns.

### Sewers - Glass Half Full
#### 1. Rift Entrance
> So there was an entrance after all. Somehow, the late owner of the Glass Half Full tavern, Saeman Havarain, had engineered an entrance into the sewers - convienelty located near the strange meeting place which our heroes had observed at the beginning on their journey and no doubt hidden by some kind of eldritch magic. Everything had come full circle now, the air primed for a final confrontation.

#### 2. Hermit's Hideway
> It is unlikely you would even learn the fate of the helpful guide, Lucas, and his dog but you came to find his camp abandoned and littered with useless refuse.

If the players search Lucas' camp, they will discover a small shining orb buried beneath the refuse with a DC 12 Investigation check.   A DC 15 Arcana check will reveal it to be an Arcane Eye, a sophisticated scrying device. It is likely that whomever conjured they eye could see through it even now.
