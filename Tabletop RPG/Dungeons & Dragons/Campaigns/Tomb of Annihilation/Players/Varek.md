## Session 7

Once more I put the pen to paper, if only to extract some coherent thought from the addled torrent of my mind. The visions get worse by the day. It is as if this mortal coil strains against its very existance, an abominable construction which knows its own anathema to the physical world. As I write I feel the evening wane into twilight, and my mind struggles to arrange the day's events into useful prose. Still, I soldier on, craving these moments of lucidity, for I realize, now, they are the last vestiges of my humanity. 

Although we find ourselves at the onset of our quest, the journey already teeters on the precipice of disaster causing me to question the effacacy of my compainions. Perhaps it is merely a question of motivation - that they do not understand the gravity of the trial laid before us. Still, the cracks in our union have shown far sooner that I could have predicted, spurred on by the opressive stillness of the Chultian jungle.
