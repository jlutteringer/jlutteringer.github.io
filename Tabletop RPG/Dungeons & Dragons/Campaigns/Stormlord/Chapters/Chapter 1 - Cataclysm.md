# Cataclysm

## Introduction
> One can't help but feel a sense of security walking the streets of this towering metropolis. Verns bears the mark of capital of the Republic, and one glance at its towering spires confirms the majesty of the greatest human empire to ever grace the realms. And yet the recent months have made clear what an illusion that security really was. The foundations of the Republic have been shattered, and it is now Verns that stands as man's last beacon of survival.

> A fierce, and truley alien race of creatures known now to the public as the Eldrazi have consumed the northern empire, leaving a trail of untold destruction in their wake. Forged by the divine in ages past, these creatures were lost to history, long believed to be mere legends of a more primitive era. Since their return, the greatest achivements of mankind have crumbled under their endless legions, and even the sacred home of the northern elves has been sacked.

> At their helm, a man named Les Stroud stalks the shadows, the engineer of the current cataclysm, he drives the nations of the Republic apart while relentlessly sieging them with his limitless alien legions. However, one ray of hope shines in the heart of the people: not a week prior, a brave group of heroes lead the combined armies of men to victory at Ahugin Breach, not more than a hundred miles north of the capital. These heroes not only spared Verns' people from the coming apocalypse, but imbued the streets of the city with a new fervor, a new hope.

> This, however, is not your story. No, we arrive at the close of another's tale, and the beginning of a new era. You feel the electricity, too, as you step out onto the city streets. The morning air is brisk, and although the day's chatter talks of victory, you sense imminent turmoil on the horizon. Fear hangs in the air like a disease, and you are certain that the coming days will test even the most formidible souls.

## The Glass Half Full

> Suddenly, a shimmering portal springs to life betwixt the bloodied runes, and an electrifying noize fills the room with an incessant buzzing. The portal leads to an alien desert landscape, huge cliffs overlooking an endless dune sea. The gasps of suprise in the crowd are quickly drowned out by shrill screams as a creature, unlike anything you have ever seen emerges from the gatway. Standing nearly as tall as a man, the circluar, chitinous body is supported by eight armored legs, each ending in a razor sharp point. The body itself is covered in unblinking eye sockets, which glow with a pale green edlritch light. Immediately, the monster spears Haley through the abdomen, and fully makes its way through the portal, which closes behind just as quickly as it had opened. As Haley's body rolls lifeless off the stage, you hear the inevitable wave of panic wash through the crowd. In the same instant, the blades of the Paladin's at the table in front of you sing from their sheaths as they leap into battle with the creature.

Haley Restala

> Auralian mutters to herself beside you. "By Helm, what have they done." As she turns to look at you all, the color has completely drained from he complextion. The woman is able to blurt but a single command before leaping to her feet, blade in hand. "Run!"

### Main Hall

> You rush through the doorway, out of the chaos, and into the hallway beyond. Havarian closes the door behind him, fumbling with his keys in trembling hands. Immediately, a sickly sweet taste overwhelms your senses, and you feel almost as if you're underwater. The sound of battle from the room beyond is almost muffled immediately, despite the only seperation being a heavy wooden door. Havarian finally locks the door with a loud click, and turns back to you with an exhasperated sigh. "That should buy us some time." He gestures to the end of the hall, leaning back against the doorway. "The kennels are at the end of the hall to the right. From there we should be able to make our way into the sewers."

> The hallway is empty, smoky, and dark - its only illumination coming from a small wall torch at its end. The hall itself is flanked by two simple wooden doors on either side, and ends at a T junction. According to Havarian, end of the all to you left will lead to your escape from this nightmare.

> You don't notice it at first. It is slow, subtle, but as you make your way down the passage the chamber is, no doubt, elongating - streching in lenght to slow your progress. For every step you take the path extends by half a step at least, and its pace is only increasing.

> Impossibly, the hallway suddenly twists in on itself. You loose your balance, and fall against one of the walls. A moment later the tunnel is back to normal, and the group has made it about halfway down. As you start to pull yourselves to your feet, you feel the all too familiar electric charge run through the air, and another shimmering portal of a desert landscape appears. To your horror, long, chitinous limbs slowly step from the threshold, and you are faced with the same creature that you witnessed slaughter so many trained soldiers in the bar.

Havarian will then attempt to convince the party to escape through one of the side doors, pleading with them that there is another way, but struggles to get the door open.

### Dining Area

> It takes some effort to push the door open, which opens to a room containing a large table with ornate place settings. The table sits twelve, and each one of them is set, but empty. In fact the room looks completely untouched, as if it was set for a meal by royalty and then just left there undisturbed. Once more there is no one here even though you could have sworn you heard screams coming from these back room at the time of the attack. 

> With the door closed, and everyone inside, there is no trace of the creature that had emeged from the portal only moments before. A lone wooden door sits opposite the room - Havarian's promised secound route.

### Kitchens

> Kitchen description... encounter?

### Cathedral

> The double doors open into a large, circular room. The room is high ceilinged and ornate. Tall, narrow windows flank the walls and the molding at the floor and cieling are clearly crafted with impeccable care. With white walls and polished marble tiles set into the floor, the room is impossibly bright. Its obvious that wherever you are it is not the Glass Half Empty tavern, as this sort of architecture could never have existed in the place. Circling the room are serveral stone altars, and atop each is a figure covered by white cloth. Finally, at the very center of the room is a large manhole, almost comically out of place, and Havarian's supposed entrance into the sewer tunnels below.

> Simon Haverian walks to the center of the room, apparently unphased by the strangeness of the situation. "See, I told you we'd find the way out" he remarked, gesturing to the large manhole in the center of the room. The man continued to make is way the the middle of the room, but as you watch him walk, he develops a limp, and then his back arches, and finally his body begins to spasm only a few feet from the center. Simon Haverian turns to face you, tears of blood running down his cheeks. After a moment he finally speaks with trembling voice - "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I have to do this. You know, I really took a liking to you lot. But I've gotta give them what they want. They have everything - I can't - can't say no. Maybe... maybe its better to die here. It's coming for all of us soon." At that, Havarian's body spasms violently, and he lets out a sharp cry before falling to all fours. Before your eyes, the man begins to transform. His arms begin to lengthen, and the bones of of his fingers grow through his hands to form wicked claws. Sharp bones pierce at his joints, and the whole transformation is marked by the sound of tearing flesh. The mans twisted figure finally rights itself, and its wicked, bloodshot eyes look out onto the group as its body begins to levitate off the ground, propelled by some unseen force.
