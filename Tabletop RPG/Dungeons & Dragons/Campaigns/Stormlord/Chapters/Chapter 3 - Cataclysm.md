# Cataclysm
> The sun's bright glare stung your eyes as armored knights pulled you from the sewers, their muffled shouts ringing through the mind's fog which enveloped you. The Order of the Vigilant Eye rushed you to a nearby garrison and it was there, as the clerics began their poking and prodding, that your senses began to return. The Cult of the Unseeing Eye unravelled - their plans foiled. But this time victory came at a great cost.  

> Steve Silversky gave his life in the final hour, not as a soldier dying for his nation, but simply as a man impressed into heroism, trying to do right by his comrades. There were others, too. Countless civilians had still yet to be found and many brave knights had already given their lives to battle the cult in the sewers below. It was a phyrric victory, to be sure. One that would be burned into the public consciousness for decades to come.

## Loghain's Revolt
With only moments left to recover, Rhys Auralian will interrupt the cleric's work, informating the players that Erik Loghain had ordered the bulk of northern garrison south to the Circle of Mages. She will indicate that upon discovering circumstancial evidenct tieing Septimus Blern to the cult, Loghain plans to sieze control of the tower and bring the man to justice by any means necessary. Finally, she believes that the group might be able to intervene and sway the commander's opinion if they so choose.

If the players fail to intervene, Loghain will succeed in taking the tower and the `Witch Hunt` outcome will occur.

If they leave immediately, the players will meet Loghain and his forces who have been delayed moving to the south of Verns. Loghain will have been delayed by High Chancellor Alerack, Seeker Alvina Thropp, and Seeker Monis Shinar at the bridge into the Merchant Quarter. The trio will be in the midst of attempting to convince Loghain to abandon his march to the Mage Circle. It is as this point the players can choose a side, and attempt to convice Loghain that he is misguided.

If unimpeded, Loghain will eventually lay siege to the Circle of Mages and without intervention by the players will breach the gate of the circle and the `Witch Hunt` outcome will occur.

If impeded, Loghain will withdraw but the Circle still faces threats. As part of gathering his forces, Loghain worked the citizens of Verns up into a frenzy. Blaming the mages for the actions of the cult, an angry mob assembles outside of the Circle. If left unimpeded the `Verns' Riots` outcome will occur.

If the players are able to subvert all of the various threats to the circle, Verns will still be subject to some rioting but the Circle will largely be safe and the `Septimus' Escape` outcome will occur.

Regardless of the outcome, Rhys will ask the players to stay at the garrison rather than the inn they were previously staying at.

### Events
Below is a listing of some random encounters which can occur during a revolt. As the players explore Verns during the revolt roll to determine events.

#### Drunken Riots
> The drunken shouts and curses preceeded the the torchlight and heavy footsteps of the group of commoners which advanced towards you. Rage burned behind their blackend silouettes as they brandished all manner of improvised weaponry: pitchforks, clubs, and the like. As if offended by its very presence, the crowd gathers around a nearby storefront, screaming drunken profanity before bathing the threshold in flames.

`3d6` beligerent, drunken rioters patrol the streets. They are loud and wield torches, making it easy to spot them from a distance. If the party wishes, it will probably be easy to avoid them but it is clear that the rioters are trouble, looting and destroying property and harassing anyone out on the street. That being said, they are still ordinary citizens and are open to being reasoned with.

#### Lost Child
> DESCRIBE ME

The party comes across an empty street ravaged by the riots. Amidst the smoke-filled air and the burned out houses they find a small girl, Elizah Maclan, crying. Elizah informs the party that she got separated from her family in all the chaos. Elizah's family worked for the Circle, not a mages but as scribes and have been killed in the riots. There is no easy answer here on what to do as Elizah is too young to provide much in the way of detail on extended family.

#### Vigilantes
> The screams came first. A man's paniced cry for help echoes down the emptied city streets.  

> You come accross a vile scene. The dark silouettes of men chuckle grimly as they hoist an elven mage high into the air, tied to a long, thick beam - a makeshift funeral pyre. Others join them, longswords at their hips, and begin to lay scrap wood at the base. Torchlight frames the scene, an imminent omen of its end.

The party comes across a group of rioters who have captured a mage, Sa'maesh Tharanadril, who works nearby at the Circle. The rioters are lead by a man named Fineas Dirketh and they have strung Tharanadril on a verticle pyre. As the party interrupts the rioters are gathering scrap wood for the pyre while Tharanadril calls for help. Dirketh and his crew are criminals using the riots as an excuse to loot and murder. As such they will be more difficult to reason with. Fineas was a shadow thief.

With a `DC 12` perception check, make a note that these rioters are well armed and not just some common rabble.

With a `DC 15` perception check, the party can notice that Dirketh and his men have probably staked out this square for awhile and have posted lookouts and bowmen in several of the nearby buildings - engaging them here in combat will be a difficult fight.

If Sa'maesh Tharanadril survives he will offer to join the party.

#### Magic Misfire
> A dramatic crack of an explosion pierces cacophany of the mayhem which has consumed the streets. Just up ahead you are stunned by a blinding flash, illuminating the alleyway in firelight. The cries of pain come next, forshadowing a grizly scene at the square up ahead.

> A man clad in robes stands defiant at the far end of the square, the better part of which has now been reduced to burning pitch. Civilians, armed with an assortment of weaponry, cower behind the rubble which now fills the streets. Several bodies are close at hand, their features seared away by magic flames.

The players come across a battle between some rioters and a Circle mage, Elnior Mustafus. This part of the city has been blackened and scorched by a recent fireball and the rioters have taken cover in the rubble while the mage rains death down upon them. Shortly after the player's arrive, a spell misfires while the mage is defending himself, transporting everyone involved to an alien landscape.

> A wounded civilian gathers what's left of his courage and sprints from his place of relative saftey, brandishing a rusted dirk. The man's wild scream howls over the crackling lumber and he charges the spellcaster, driven by nought but bloodlust. Another spell streaks through the night, bathing the cortyard in an emerald glow. A second flash overwhelms the first, drowning your vision in piercing white. In the chaos you hear the mage let out a pained yell and then suddenly your surroundings slip away from you. Blinded and disoriented, you find nothing but air beneath your feet and a scream wells in your lungs as you futilly grasp for some sort of purhase.

> As far as you recall, it took only moments for your senses to return. As you shield your eyes from the bright daylight which washes over you, it is immediately apparent that you are no longer in Verns. You stand atop what looks like a huge, pinkish-crystal shard which is somehow suspended in mid air. Around you, many other sister shards float in a similar manner, suspended by nothingness. Blue skies surroud you on top and bottom, with nothing resembling a landmass in sight. In the distance, fluffy white clouds spindle through the sky like strung out cottonballs. This is truely an alien place.

> The others are here, too. Scattered about the constellation of crystals, every member of your party is accounted for, including the group of rioters and the mage who presumably brought you to this place. The spellcaster in question sits with his knees splayed, and holds a hand to his side - wounded somehow in this great calamity.

> Finally, you see something else on the horizon. A fleet of proud ships, who sail through the sky without the need for wind or water. Hanging from the masts, translucent sails sparkle in the daylight made of fabric of a thoroughly unfamiliar construction. The ships sail not for you but rather travel though this fantasy world towards some unknown destination, their hulls pushing the pinkish crystals out of their paths with the slightest of ease.

The spell misfire lands the party in a pocket dimension similar to the astral plane. Large, pinkish crystals serve as the only solid ground as the float around a void of blue sky and puffy white mist, closely resembling clouds. In the distance a Githyanki fleet streaks through the sky, their large ships of the line just pushing the crystals out of the way.

With a `DC 15` arcana check a player can recognise the ships as Githyanki vessles and recall some details about the Githyanki themselves.

If the party lacks familarity with the Githyanki, Elnior informs them with some light details and explains that the Githyanki fleet might be the best chance of returning to the material plane. He says the Githyanki have specialized mages who they call navigators, and that they posess the power to switch between planes. With the help of a Navigator, or with the use of a Navigator's staff, Elnior belives he can return the party back from whence they came.

If Elnior Mustafus survives he will offer to join the party.

#### Witch Hunters
A group of disgruntled soldiers patrol the city looking for rogue mages, either taking them to the stockades or provided and expedited sentencing. If the party is spotted, these soldiers will suspect them of harboring spellcasters and threaten to take the whole group in for questioning. One easy out, if the party mentions their involvement in stopping the cult one of the soldiers will vouch for recognition and the group will let the party pass without further hassle.

#### Tavern Fire!
> DESCRIBE ME

Rioters have set a tavern on fire, sending the clientelle into mayhem!

### Outcome - Witch Hunt
> Few things were beyond the reach of the Republic's Legions and the Circle of Mages was no exception. Legionairres battered their way through the gates with little resistance as the Republic turned against itself. It was a bloodbath. The men were fueled by rage, on an quest for vengeance to bring Septimus Blern and his co-conspirators to justice. Erik Loghain cared little for the mages of the Circle and he cast a wide net. Innocent mages were dragged from the colleges and put to death in the streets by packs of vigilante soldiers.

> The mob, its hatred fuled by months of fear, finally had an enemy to fight. Loghain ordered his men to step aside and the populace ran rampant. The south of Verns burned as the inquisition spilled out from the Circle, consuming the surrounding neighborhoods. There was little in the way of mercy - for all looked guilty by the light of the pyre.

> The night concluded, a stark blaze against the inky backdrop of night as the Circle Tower burned, twisted flames licking its majestic scaffold.

* Circle of Mages is breached and badly damaged
* Public executions of mages run rampant
* Septimus Blern is found and killed
* King Heclair strips Loghain of his rank and promotes Rhys Auralian to temporary commander of the northern garrison
* Avernus withdraws its forces
* The Orlesian Rose is dissolved
* King Heclair states his intent to resign as governor

### Outcome - Verns' Riots
> The Repiblic Legions had abandoned thier posts at the Circle. Although denyed his moment of triumph, Loghain would throw his enemy to the dogs, a raving mob which he himself instilled by pinning the actions of the Cult of the Unseeing Eye on the Circle. The fight at the circle gates was quick and decisive. Fearing for their lives, sorcerors send plumes of fire streaking into the crowds. In mere moments, hundreds had been incinerated and the crowds were sent into full retreat.

> The mob, its hatred fuled by months of fear, finally had an enemy to fight. Loghain ordered his men to step aside and the populace ran rampant. The south of Verns burned as the inquisition spilled out from the Circle, consuming the surrounding neighborhoods. There was little in the way of mercy - for all looked guilty by the light of the pyre.

* Circle of Mages is secure
* Many rioters are killed by magic
* Public executions of mages are prevalent
* Septimus Blern escapes
* King Heclair strips Loghain of his rank and promotes Rhys Auralian to temporary commander of the northern garrison
* Avernus withdraws its forces

### Outcome - Septimus' Escape
> The Repiblic Legions had abandoned thier posts at the Circle. Although denyed his moment of triumph, Loghain would throw his enemy to the dogs, a raving mob which he himself instilled by pinning the actions of the Cult of the Unseeing Eye on the Circle. The impending conflict, however, was miraculously averted thanks to the efforts of the Heroes of Westwind who managed to talk down the crowds in the final hour.

> The mob dispersed, although some in its ranks were less than convinced by the heroes' plea. Loghain had ordered his men to step aside those who remained ran rampant. The south of Verns burned as the inquisition spilled away from the Circle, consuming the surrounding neighborhoods. There was little in the way of mercy - for all looked guilty by the light of the pyre.

* Circle of Mages is secure
* Public executions of mages are rare
* Septimus Blern escapes

## Audience with the King
The next morning, the party will recieve an official audience to present themselves before King Radovid Heclair II as soon as possible. The envoy will inform them that the King wishes to thank the Heroes of Westwind personally as well as discuss some other sensitive matters regarding the Cult of the Unseeing Eye. Finally, the envoy with part by giving them a physical invitation which will let the party pass through Fort Bragg and on to the palace isle and directions to the palace.

To reach the palace, the players will need to arrive at Fort Bragg, pass through the security checkpoint there, cross the Champs-Elysees and then make their way across the palace lawns and into the Palace of the White Opal.

> Read Description in Settings > Aurum > Locations > Verns > Palace Isle > Fort Bragg

At Ft. Bragg, the party will be approached by a man who introduces himself as Galeen Bale. Bale will inform the party that a new criminal organization is on the rise by making use of the title of Shadow Thieves. He says that he will pay the party handsomely (300g) if they manage to find out the identiy of this new kingpin impostor. Through his own investigation, he has learned that these so called Shadow Thieves are taking recruits at the Delmirth Tavern - that the party should introduce themselves to the bartender as Aran Linvale. This opens up the sidequest: `Shadow Impersonators`.

> Read Description in Settings > Aurum > Characters > Galeen Bale

While crossing the Champs-Elysees, the players will once again run into High Chancellor Alerack, who will comment on the previous night.

> Read Description in Settings > Aurum > Locations > Verns > Palace Isle > Champs-Elysees

> Read Description in Settings > Aurum > Locations > Verns > Palace Isle > Palace of the White Opal

The players will meet the King in a great dining hall along with Simeon Silversky and Florial Starflower - surviving members of Steve Silversky's family and Nastor Alastain - head of Orlesian intelligence. The King will merely introduce Alastain as his advisor and will reassure the party that they may speak freely in his presence.

King Radovid formost wished to meet the so-called "Heroes of Westwind", honor them, and mourn the loss of their companion with them. He will invite the party to dine with the four of them, and ask them to join him for a memorial service to honor the fallen citizens and soldiers - many of whom are still considered missing - who perished in the Westwind incident. The ceremony itself is not for a few hours and the party will be honored guests of the castle, able to relax and enjoy the amenities in the meantime.

At the end of the dinner, Radovid will intent that the would like the players to speak to Alastain in private after the ceremony - that he has an offer for them to consider.

> Read Description in Settings > Aurum > Locations > Verns > Palace Isle > Palace of the White Opal > Great Hall

> Radovid faced away from you as you entered the hall, observing the palace lawn from the great window which made up the east wall, his hands folded behind his back.

> Read Description in Settings > Aurum > Characters > Radovid Heclair II

Describe the other characters as Radovid introduces them.

> Read Description in Settings > Aurum > Characters > Nastor Alastain

> The two elves in Radovid's compay sat togther, almost comically alone at the end of the huge feasting table which dominated much of the great hall. Their grief was plain - red eyes and tear streaked cheeks were common between the pair, though they tried to mantain some manner of composure in these unfamilair circumstances. The man, Simeon Silversky, bore an uncanny resemblance to your deceased companion, Steve Silversky. It was obvious through his weathered appearance that he was the man's father or close relative. The woman, Florial, would have been a prototypical example of Elven grace under any other circumstances her well kept hair and fair skin indicating a life that was spared from the hardships of her companion.

King Heclair's speech:
> People of Verns. As you all know our brothers and sisters in Westwind have suffered a terrible tragedy over the past week. I speak for our city, our nation, and our Republic when I say that our deepest sympathies go out to them. Loss is always a challenge, but we as a people must begin to accept that loss is our new way of life. Make no mistake - we are at war both here and at the front. These fiends, these denizens of hell, would like nothing more than to destroy all we have built - to bring humanity to its very knees. We will not let them! The Republic's Legions will stand against the darkness and prevail! We will stand against darkness to the very end.

> And so, it is with this in mind that we honor the fallen and celebrate their sacrifice, their lives, and our victory. The Cult of the Unseeing Eye has been defeated, their plans foiled. We as a people are victorious! So let us not give in to our biases. Let us not make an enemy of our neighbor. No! Let us reject cinisism and reject fear! If we cannot stand here now, as one people, then what hope do we have to face the enemy at our doorstep? To face the coming apocalypse!? We will stand togther, and we will stand resolute!

> And now, allow me to introduce a group of men and women far greater than I. A group of ordinary citizens who rose to the occasion, dismantling the Unseeing Eye's apparatus in one fel blow! I present to you, good people, true heroes - the Heroes of Westwind!

Give the players an opportunity to speak.

> One of these brave souls is not here today. Steve Silversky, a ranger from Tectus, and a lover of the outdoors, made the ultimate sacrifice for our Republic. I have personally comissioned a memorial in his likeness by our most talented stonesmith - to be constructed right here on the palace lawn. May Lathandar guide his soul unto a glorius new dawn. He is survived here by his family friends - Simeon Silversky and Florial Starflower - please give them your heartfelt condolences and thanks for Mr. Silversky's unyielding dedication to this great Republic.

> Let us embrace Silversky's sacrifice. Let us cement his heroism in our minds, honor his memory, and cast aside our divisions. Today we are all Orlesian. Today, we are all citizens of the Republic - so we say: "Victory or death! For Verns! For Orleans! And for the Republic!"

Phillip will awaken in a cold sweat. He will feel a strong connection to the Eldrazi. Give him the option to resist or embrace the call. If he resists, make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. If he embraces the power, her gains the benifits of Foresight.

> Chaos reigns. The south of Verns stands brigtly ablaze against the morning's twilight, a result of the explosions which shook the city only moments before. Soot and ash fill the air contributing a sense of panic on the streets of the city which the ringing of warning bells does not abate. Soldiers from the garrison have already begun to arm themselves and stream into the streets, no doubt readying themselves for the coming storm.

### The Northern Garrison
Under the leadership of the Order forces gather at the northern garrison, ready to push south into the city. The players will consult with Rhys and her war council oh how to proceed.

### Separated
> Suddenly a great crack of thunder shook the platoon to its very foundations. Arcing from the top of the palace, a greenish bolt of energy surged skyward, illuminating the early morning sky in a sickly green glow. It would have almost been awe inspiring was it not for the sky tearing itself asunder. All the people of Verns stared up into another ream, a realm with which you were well aquainted.
> Now suspended in the sky above the city was a vast desert, with pockets of rocky outcroppings breaking up the rolling, sandy hills. The Eldrazi had come. Large geometric shapes, seemingly molded out of single blocks of stone, hovered in the air and slowly descended past the barrier between worlds. The craft themselves were too numerous to count. Above them was a creature so gargautuan it defied all logic. One who's name had already been burned into your minds - Emrakul. The apocalypse had come.

DC 15 perception check to spot the incoming Hedron and warn the troops. If no warning, DC `12` dex save to avoid taking `1d6` damage and being trapped under rubble. Players can free trapped soldiers or other players with a DC `12` strength check.

### Blowing the Bridges
A small coalition of legionaires gathers around the north end of a major bridge in Verns. The Watcher joins them as they intend to hold the line until the bridge can be destroyed. With the players help, The Watcher puts her plan into motion - she explains the situation and then gives the players a few minutes to plan. Soon the encounter will begin as the Eldrazi front arrives.

#### Hold the Line
The encounter begins as Watcher joins a group of soldiers at one end of the bridge - the objective to hold the line until the demolitionists below can plant charges on each of the three support pillars holding the bridge. While the line holds Watcher channels a healing aura with radius `2` on the bridge. Any player who ends the turn in the aura heals for `3d8` hit points.

At the beginning of the encounter, a player can make a DC `15` performance check to inspire the troops, adding an additional `2` toughness to the bridge defense.

##### Bridge Defense
The soldiers on the bridge have an initial toughness of `10`. The players can assign support squads to reinforce the bridge each raising the total toughness by the remaining toughness of the squad. Each round the soldiers spend holding the Eldrazi forces at bay typtically decreases thier toughness by `3`. However, if the bridge defenses are flanked they lose `1` additional toughness at the end of the round. If the soldier's toughness reaches 0, the bridge defenses are breached and enemies will pour fourth from the bridge.

##### Archer Support
The second stories of two large homes which flank the bridge make perfect archer nests and the legions have already stationed two groups of archers there. From this vantage point the archers are able to relive some of the pressure from the bridge. As long as the archer units aren't engaged they each reduce the toughness lost by the bridge team per round by `1`. If a support squad is stationed with the archers they are able to hold off `1` enemy unit before the archers are considered to be engaged. Each archer unit begins with a toughness of `2` and loses `1` toughness for each engaged enemy at the end of each round.

##### Demolition Team
The demolition team has a small boat docked on the northern bank and plans to sail to each support pillar and arm explosives at the base. It takes `1` round to sail to a pillar and `1` round to attach the explosives. The team has a toughness of `3` and loses `1` toughness for each engaged enemy at the end of each round. While engaged, the demolition team cannot make progress. Additionally, the demolition team's boat can only hold `2` players or `1` support squad. The player's might come up with an innovative way to arm the explosives more quickly - these alternative methods should be encouraged and the DM should adjucate appropriately.

##### Support Squads
Finally, the players have `3` melee support squads which they can assign additional orders. The squad has a toughness of `3` and loses `1` toughness for each engaged enemy at the end of each round. Additionally, if the squad survives after taking damage at the end of the round it kills one unit which it is engaged with.

##### Round by Round
At the beginning of each round, roll 1d20 + current round number. If the roll is > `11`, roll `3` times to determine where the Eldrazi attack. Otherwise roll once.

Roll randomly to determine which point gets attacked. Duplicated rolls mean that point is attacked by more than one enemy:
* Left Tower
* Right Tower
* Flank Bridge
* Demolition Team

Then, for each attack, roll randomly on the table below to determine the type of attacking unit:
* Wrack Spawn (2)
* Ulamog's Crusher
* Emrakul's Defiler
* Manipulator (3)

##### Round 3
On the beginning round 3, a DC `15` perception check will reveal that an Eldrazi prism is heading for tower. If a player is stationed in the right tower, the can make this check with advantage. 

Roll the reinforce roll twice on this round.

##### Round 4
On the beginning of round 4, the Eldrazi prisim will destroy the right tower. Any squads in the tower are immediately destroyed. Any players in the tower must succede on a DC `12` dexterity saving throw or be immediately reduced to 0 hp and be buried in the rubble.

Skip the Eldrazi reinforce roll for this round.

##### Final Stand
If the bridge defense fails, `4` units of Eldrazi will cross the bridge at the beginning of each subsequent round but the demolition team will be able to operate unmolested. Roll randomly on the table above to determine the type of unit.

#### Zuriel
Zuriel arrives at the beginning of the next round after the bridge is destroyed, flying down to land at its end, destroying any remaining bridge defenders in the process. Zuriel starts at the top of the initiative and will immediately cast his `Investiture of Lightning` without targeting any players.

> DESCRIBE ZURIEL'S ARRIVAL - SOLDIERS ON BRIDGE

> DESCRIBE ZURIEL'S ARRIVAL - NO SOLDIERS

Zuriel and Watcher will focus on fighting each other, and Watcher will ask the party to destroy the Investitures. Every round, `1` additional Eldrazi unit will enter the battle, climbing up from the bridge or flying in. Like before roll on the table above for its type.

##### Round 3
At the beginning of round 3, Zuriel begins to channel `Kneel, Insect!` on Watcher, blasting her back and leaving her stunned. Until the remaining investitures are destroyed, this channel will continue.

Whenever all the investitures are destroyed, Watcher immediately acts, shattering Zuriel's blade and leaving him greviously wounded. In the process, Zuriel will kill Watcher, throwing her lifeless body aside.

If the players investigate the fragment of Zuriel's shattered blade, `Zethothrax`, they can discern it is a powerful magic item with a casting of `Detect Magic` or with a DC `15` Arcana check. These sources of power will have more importance later in chapter 4.

> DESCRIBE WATCHER'S DEFEAT

> DESCRIBE WATCHER VS ZURIEL

Any remaining Eldrazi will flee, and the players will confront `Zuriel (Wounded)` who will act at the end of the initiative.

> DESCRIBE ZURIELS DEATH

##### Round 6
At the beginning of round 6, if Zuriel is still channeling `Kneel, Insect!`, he will overwhelm Watcher, killing her instantly. At this point the party will likely have to retreat and Zuriel will be victorious. Be sure to emphasize the angel's overwhelming power at this point.

#### Outcomes
If the players decide to retreat before the bridge is destroyed Watcher will cover them, dieing in attempt to hold off the hordes. The players will not recover the `Holy Avenger` and the north of Verns will be breached. This will result in only half the number of unskilled and skilled laborers joining the party at the close of this chapter.

If Zuriel kills Watcher before being weakend, Zuriel will survive and the players will likely not recover the `Holy Avenger` but the north of Verns will be secured. Zuriel will not pursue the party as long as they leave Watcher's sword behind.

Finally, if the players flee from Zuriel after he is wounded. They will both recover both the `Holy Avenger` and protect Verns, but Zuriel will survive his wounds and eventually recover.

The best outcome results in the defense of Verns, the recovery of the `Holy Avenger` and the death of the fallen angel.

### Aegis Front
> DESCRIBE THE DISTANT FORT BRAG

> Brilliant sunlight split the storm which now raged around Fort Brag and the Third Legion, a waning sign that dawn had finally broken across the battlefield. The first rays of light came accompanied by a thunderous boom, drowning out the calamaty of strife. A great figure entered on that rolling thunder, appearing in the sky clad in gleaming platemail against the sunlight and suspended by a pair of etheral wings. The archangel spoke in regal tones, its voice commanding the attention of the battle below.

> Denisens of the Mortal Realm: the heavens have not abandoned you! It is fitting, that in mankind's final hour, men and angels once more draw blades togther to fight back the darkness and usher in a glorious New Dawn. Let the halls of Mount Celestia ring with the command of Lathandar, the Morning Lord - "No longer will I stand in apathy towards my subjects. For the Golden Sun and for humanity's legacy! We will banish these creatures back to the abyss from which they crawled!"

> The armies of heaven arrive.

### Encounter with Drogan Steelwrought
On the way to Fort Brag, the party will encounter Drogan Steelwrought, some hired hands, and a cart which carries the merchant's most valuable belongings. Drogan himself will be wearing his suit of modular platemail, and carrying a heavy repeating crossbow.

One of the merchant's four guards will have succumbed to a manipulator, and the group will be debating on what to do with him, with Drogan strongly favoring leaving the man behind.

Items of Note:
* 2 Heavy Repeating Crossbow - As a heavy crossbow but removes the loading property.
* Modular Platemail - As platemail, but can be donned and doffed in a single round.
