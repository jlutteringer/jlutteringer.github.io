# The Unseeing Eye
> Waves crashing against the pier muffle the motions of the Shadow Thieves as they fade into the darkness of the night. You walk an uncertain path, but one thing is clear - the plans of this eyeless cult must be thwarted, and quickly, as with every passing moment the time of their dark ritual draws nearer. Joined with you are two new companions, agents of the masters you now serve. You can't help but quietly wonder if you are being made a pawn in some larger game.

## Gaining Access
There are several obvious avenues for the players to gain access to the ritual site. Victor will suggest infiltrating the cult or finding a way to breach the barrier, but will have limited details on both options. The player's search will be time limited, as Victor will reveal - the ritual is to take place in exactly seven days during the dead of night. Finally, Victor will inform that the players that the cult is aware of what they know, and aware of the Shadow Thieves' plan to foil their plot and to, if possible, only interact with the cultists with a convincing disguise.

### Exposing Serevain
There exists enough evidence to make a damning case against the Archmage scattered throughout the Mage's Complex in Verns. Acessing the complex in the first place will be difficult. Serevain is careful, and his offices in the Spire will lead to few results. However, documents within will hint towards a more secretive workspace build down into the Underbelly of the complex.

#### The Underbelly
// TODO

### Infiltration
The Cult of the Unseeing Eye is recruiting for the coming apocalpyse, but their recruiters must stay in the shadows for obvious reasons. Aditionally, since the cultists are on the lookout for the PCs, it would be advisable for the PCs to somehow conceal their identetites.

There are several means of locating cultist recruiters:
* A sucessful DC 15 Investigation check revelas the location of a nightly meeting and the Delmirth Tavern on the south side of Verns and indicates that the cultists may use these nightly get togthers as covert recruting opportunities. Characters who have signficiant knowledge of the capital would likely have advantage on this Investigation roll. 
* Interrogating local bartenders will likely lead to vague information regarding the Delmirth Tavern. Once there, players might recognise that cultist recruiters bear similar garb to the summoners which attacked the Glass Half Empty tavern on the first night.
* Conversing with the local city watch might reveal that cultist activity has been more active in the south of the city
* The evening of the second day, text will appear in the journal that the players carry. In it will have the written message: "I have more new blood coming your way. Meet in KT - the usual spot."

#### Delmirth Tavern
> It was a horrid place - truely a den of man's most depraved debauchery. The surrounding districts were gripped by poverty brought on by the stresses of war. This place had long since been abandoned by what little guard postings remained and slowly began to sink into a state of apathetic anarchy. It was a true testament to how far the Republic had sank - the kingdom couldn't even control it's own captial.  
> Still, the tavern itself was patroned by all sorts of ilk. The threshold was crowned with a goat's head - freshly slain, and the inside of the tavern was dimly lit and fill with the pungent aroma of burnt hash. A balding, portly man, who leant behind the bar, eyed you as you entered - the arrival of a strange a looking sort as your party causing a hush to fall over the chamber.

In the evening, a backroom of the tavern will fill up with two cultist recruiters and several canidates, all dressed in dark leathers. While the meeting itself might look like a gathering of brigands, they all speak in hushed tones - quite the contrast from the rest of the establishment.

The players expressing an interest in knowing or joining the cult of the Unseeing Eye will prompt the recruiters to offer them a seat at a table and introduce themselves as Ram Haxley and Jacobin Marogue. The recruiters will question the players on a few matters, but after some convincing will inform the group of a meeting location in a clearing to the east of Ketlam Glade, a small forrestry village to the south of the capital. If the recruiters manage to discern the true identity of the players the will arrange to ambush them at the glade.

#### The Journey

The Journey to Ketlam Glade is about half a day's travel on foot if you're taking the main road, or around a full day if you attempt to take a more circuitous route through the woods themselves.

The players will avoid any encounters if they take the route through the woods. If they take the main road however, they will encounter a wagon under attack by Eldrazi.

> Shouts and the ring of metal on metal echo against the close cropped treeline bordering the main road. You see torchlight up ahead, and the shadow silouettes of figures which weave a deadly dance in the flickering light. From this distance it appears to be some sort of carriage and it's escort, and they are clearly in need of assistance.

Encounter: 3 Mercenaries vs. 3 Spawns of Ulamog and 5 Pawns of Ulamog

Watcher's theme: https://soundcloud.com/inoue-konoha/08-winterspell

#### Ketlam Glade
> On the surface, Ketlam Glade was completely untouched by the warfare which had ravaged the surrounding countryside. Perched beneath twisting trunks of elder oaks, it's thatched roofed homes were the picture of a perfectly quaint village, a place any adventurer would wish to retire to.  
> More sinister, however, was the ruined Harkam Cathedral, a long forgottom patronage to the Morning Lord, which perched atop the lone moutain nearby like a gargolye stalking the innocence of the village below.

Unbeknownst to most, Ketlam Glade serves as the strongold of the cult. In fact, Harkam Cathedral perched above serves as the lair of the Planetar Zuriel, servant of Talos. That being said, nearly all members of the village are either directly involved with or sympethic to the cult, and will attempt to hamper the progress of the players if they are overtly hostile to the Cult of the Unseeing Eye.

#### The Clearing
> The small party gathered at midday in the middle of the grassy clearing. It would be a picturesque scene if not for the standoff which currently unfolded. An unknown man, flanked by two robed cultists, stood opposite four familiar faces - the same four from the Delmirth tavern the night before. It seemed the party was already engaged in some sort of negotion.

> Read the Zealot description

> Caliphus was truely an imposing figure. Shirtless, inked tattos snaked across his skin; symbols of his religion and a testament to his faith, and he wore deep scars; symbols of his prowess in battle. Power radiated from him. There are precious few in this world who bear such abilities, a living conduit of divine power, and indisputable proof that the Stormlord survived his avatar's destruction at the hands of man.

Caliphus' theme: https://soundcloud.com/k-s-lovencrone/dark-ages-two-steps-from-hell

The clearing has about a 100ft radius, with Caliphus and the recruits from the tavern gatherd at the center. With a `DC 15` perception check, players will notice ten other figures which remain hidden, spaced around the clearing at the edge of the wooded area. These are ten other Zealots which will advance into the clearing at Caliphus' gesture to do his bidding.

Caliphus should ask the players to empty their belongings if he suspects that one of the linked journals have been compromized. If found, Caliphus will order his minions to apprehend the players and bring them to Harkam Cathedral, the bastion of the Unseeing Eye.

The players will meet the group from the Delmirth tavern along with Visier Caliphus and two Zealots. Ultimately, Caliphus will express gratitude that the party has a mage in the ranks, and will express the need for a single group. Then, he will order the party to kill the other mercenary group proof of their loyalty.

On completion of the task, Caliphus will direct the party nothwest, towards the Baram Moors, about a days journey on foot from the town.

#### Captured
> It took some time for your eyes to adjust to the light, as your blindfolds were ripped off by the cultist soldiers. Whatever was next in store - Caliphus wanted you to see it. The stone floored chamber was massive, it's vaulted cieling reaching at least a hunded feet into the sky. The chamber was more or less rectangular, and your party had been halted at the near midpoint. Thin, cathedral windows draped themselves along the walls, bathing the chamber in brilliant sunlight. There was no mistaking it, the aged stonework gave the secret immediately, this was the sanctum of Harkam Cathedral. Sure enough, the worn symbol of the Morning Lord watch over you, boldly carved against the stone of the far wall.  
> The chamber was empty, save for a thin obelisk which protruded from the floor at the center and rose to almost thirty feet. It unmistakably dominated the room. The structure was deep black, and appeared to either be carved from obsidian or scorched by flame beyond recognition. It's surface was covered in complex arcane symbols which burned with a sinister red glow. You felt it, then. Rage. Dread. Hopelessnes. It was a familiar feeling, burned into your mind only days past as you looked down at the scene unfolding beneath the Republic's sewers. The answer came to you almost as quickly, burning itself in your mind all the same. A seal and a name - Emrakul. This is what the Unseeing Eye sought so desperately, and what was buried beneath the palace at the center of Verns.
> The thunderous clap which shook the room next sent you sprawling backwards and a shimmering portal burst into existence before the obelisk. Beyond it was a landscape which had become all too familar and desert sands were tossed haphazardly into the cathedral by the arid windswells which ran across the dunes beyond. The figure which stepped from that threshold dwarfed any man. Standing at almost ten feet and clad in ebony robes, his mere presence sent Caliphus dropping to a knee. Brilliant wings of white feather unfurled from the creature's back and he spoke, voice booming in the holy sanctum...

Zuriel's theme: https://soundcloud.com/narrisnor/forze-dell-oscurita

If captured, the players will be taken to confront Zuriel in the sanctum of Harkam Cathedral, and come face to face with one of the opened seals. Zuriel will note that the players are strong of spirit, and instruct Caliphus to bestow the with their masters' gift in order to see what they may know about the impending plot.

Caliphus, accompanied by two guards will place the players in cells, but select on of them for the process of Eldrazi Conscription. The player will be throw bound and unarmed into a shallow pit with about 15ft walls and a 30ft diameter. A manipulator will then be throw into the pit with them, and they will have to find some way to survive. If they are coerced by the creature, the character will be effectively removed from play, and will willing volunteer all of the secrets that the players have gathered thus far.

If the players are unable to make some manner of escape in the Cathedral, they will be transferred by horseback to the cult's operations in Baram Moors, with the intent to use them as blood sacrifices to enhance the ritual. The players will be transported, bound, by a contengient of eight Zealots, who will rendevous with Chancellor Marik outside the main gates of Spire Zizziax.

## The Ritual

### Midway Fortifications
Rhys Auralian and Arik Stevens had rode up to the Midway Fortification, in expectation of the players returning from the Baram Moor. Rhys will inform the party that Erik Loghain failed to approve her suggestion of sending reinforcing Knights North to the Moor, so she and Stevens had defied orders and road northward through the night, bringing horses and fresh supplies. Naturally, the two will express curiosity towards the players accomplishments, asking about anything they managed to discover.

After the initial meeting, Rhys will suggest that the party return to the capital post-haste. Additionally, she will give Stevens orders to ride North to Ahugin Breach, and request General Angolis' mounted Reiksguard to ride South and reinforce Verns. If pressed, she will reveal that she lacks a specific threat in mind, but simply has a feeling that the theater of this saga has shifted Southward.

### Verns
Having stopped Chancellor Marik and the Unseeing Eye from siphoning magical energy from the specter of Liam Zizziax, the players will find on their return to Verns that the dark barrier which had consumed much of the Northern districts of the city had vanished. The North side of the city will see increased military prescence as the party nears the Glass Half Full tavern, where it all begain.
