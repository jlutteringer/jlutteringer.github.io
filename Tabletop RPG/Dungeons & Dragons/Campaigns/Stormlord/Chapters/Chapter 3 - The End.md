# The End
> The sun's bright glare stung your eyes as armored knights pulled you from the sewers, their muffled shouts ringing through the mind's fog which enveloped you. The Order of the Vigilant Eye rushed you to a nearby garrison and it was there, as the clerics began their poking and prodding, that your senses began to return. The Cult of the Unseeing Eye unravelled - their plans foiled. But this time victory came at a great cost.  
> Steve Silversky gave his life in the final hour, not as a soldier dying for his nation, but simply as a man impressed into heroism, trying to do right by his comrades. There were others, too. Countless civilians had still yet to be found and many brave knights had already given their lives to battle the cult in the sewers below. It was a phyrric victory, to be sure. One that would be burned into the public consciousness for decades to come.

## Loghain's Revolt
With only moments left to recover, Rhys Auralian will interrupt the cleric's work, informating the players that Erik Loghain had ordered the bulk of northern garrison south to the Circle of Mages. She will indicate that upon discovering circumstancial evidenct tieing Septimus Blern to the cult, Loghain plans to sieze control of the tower and bring the man to justice by any means necessary. Finally, she believes that the group might be able to intervene and sway the commander's opinion if they so choose.

If the players fail to intervene, Loghain will succeed in taking the tower and the `Witch Hunt` outcome will occur.

If they leave immediately, the players will meet Loghain and his forces who have been delayed moving to the south of Verns. Loghain will have been delayed by High Chancellor Alerack, Seeker Alvina Thropp, and Seeker Monis Shinar. The trio will be in the midst of attempting to convince Loghain to abandon his march to the Mage Circle. It is as this point the players can choose a side, and attempt to convice Loghain that he is misguided.

If unimpeded, Loghain will eventually lay siege to the Circle of Mages and without intervention by the players will breach the gate of the circle and the `Witch Hunt` outcome will occur.

If impeded, Loghain will withdraw but the Circle still faces threats. As part of gathering his forces, Loghain worked the citizens of Verns up into a frenzy. Blaming the mages for the actions of the cult, an angry mob assembles outside of the Circle. If left unimpeded the `Verns' Riots` outcome will occur.

If the players are able to subvert all of the various threats to the circle, Verns will still be subject to some rioting but the Circle will largely be safe and the `Septimus' Escape` outcome will occur.

### Events
Below is a listing of some random encounters which can occur during a revolt. As the players explore Verns during the revolt roll to determine events.

#### Drunken Riots
> DESCRIBE ME

`3d6` beligerent, drunken rioters patrol the streets. They are loud and wield torches, making it easy to spot them from a distance. If the party wishes, it will probably be easy to avoid them but it is clear that the rioters are trouble, looting and destroying property and harassing anyone out on the street. That being said, they are still ordinary citizens and are open to being reasoned with.

#### Lost Child
> DESCRIBE ME

The party comes across an empty street ravaged by the riots. Amidst the smoke-filled air and the burned out houses they find a small girl, Elizah Maclan, crying. Elizah informs the party that she got separated from her family in all the chaos. Elizah's family worked for the Circle, not a mages but as scribes and have been killed in the riots. There is no easy answer here on what to do as Elizah is too young to provide much in the way of detail on extended family.

#### Vigilantes
> DESCRIBE ME

The party comes across a group of rioters who have captured a mage, Sa'maesh Tharanadril, who works nearby at the Circle. The rioters are lead by a man named Fineas Dirketh and they have strung Tharanadril on a verticle pyre. As the party interrupts the rioters are gathering scrap wood for the pyre while Tharanadril calls for help. Dirketh and his crew are criminals using the riots as an excuse to loot and murder. As such they will be more difficult to reason with.

With a `DC 15` perception check, the party can notice that Dirketh and his men have probably staked out this square for awhile and have posted lookouts and bowmen in several of the nearby buildings - engaging them here in combat will be a difficult fight.

If Sa'maesh Tharanadril survives he will offer to join the party.

#### Magic Misfire
> DESCRIBE ME

The players come across a battle between some rioters and a Circle mage, Elnior Mustafus. This part of the city has been blackened and scorched by a recent fireball and the rioters have taken cover in the rubble while the mage rains death down upon them. Shortly after the player's arrive, a spell misfires while the mage is defending himself, transporting everyone involved to an alien landscape.

> DESCRIBE ME

The spell misfire lands the party in a pocket dimension similar to the astral plane. Large, pinkish crystals serve as the only solid ground as the float around a void of blue sky and puffy white mist, closely resembling clouds. In the distance a Githyanki fleet streaks through the sky, their large ships of the line just pushing the crystals out of the way. Elnior quickly explains the situation.

If the party lacks familarity with the Githyanki, Elnior informs them with some light details and explains that the Githyanki fleet might be the best chance of returning to the material plane. He says the Githyanki have specialized mages who they call navigators, and that they posess the power to switch between planes. With the help of a Navigator, or with the use of a Navigator's staff, Elnior belives he can return the party back from whence they came.

If Elnior Mustafus survives he will offer to join the party.

#### Witch Hunters
> DESCRIBE ME

A group of disgruntled soldiers patrol the city looking for rogue 
#### Tavern Fire!
> DESCRIBE ME

Rioters have set a tavern on fire, sending the clientelle into mayhem!
