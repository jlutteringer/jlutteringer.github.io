# The Unseeing Eye

## Zealot
> This human his clad in dark robes, with a light suit of mail underneath. At his side brandishes an ornamental short spear, which inlaid with gold trim and intricate runic carvings. The symbol of Talos, the Stormlord, is brazenly carved into the unusually broad blade of the weapon. The man's face is hidden by a metallic mask, one that bears stark resemblance to that of some of the other masked figures you have seen in the past.

# The Eldrazi

## Pawn of Ulamog
> The creature before you bears little remnant of it's humanity. Appearing as a discheveld man in torn or tattered clothing, it suffers from horrific deformities which cover the body. Bits of bone that have grown into sharp points extrude from the skin at the joints, and its hands and mouth more closely resemble monstrous claws and fangs. A large, pulsing creature is fused into the man's spine, it's claws digging deeply into the the man's exposed flesh.

## Spawn of Ulamog
> It was a twisted, vaguely humanoid creature which crawled towards you, almost writhing in it's movements. It's hairless body bore a green, slimy hue, and it's head was featureless save for a wide, circular mouth with dagger-like teeth. The creature crawled along the ground with suprising dexterity, propelled by four powerful clawed arms. It's legs were missshapen and useless, deformed appendages which dragged behind the creature. A mockery of humanity, this alien horror almost defies description.

## Manipulator
> This creature is an agile spawn of the Eldrazi, about the size of a small dog. Its body is a featurless hexagonal prisim, grayish-red in color and covered in insectoid chitin plates. Six segmented legs sprout from the base and are accompanied by a long, barbed tail, much like that of a scorpion.

| Conscription | On a successful barbed tail attack against an incapacitated opponent, the manipulator can, as a bouns action, conscript its target to join the Eldrazi hivemind. The target makes a DC 10 constitution saving throw, on a success it takes 5d6 damage as the Manipulator tries to burrow into its spine, on a failed save the Manipulator latches onto the targets spine. For every turn the Manipulator is attached, the target must make a DC 15 Wisdom save. Upon death or a failed save, the target becomes a pawn of the Eldrazi. |
