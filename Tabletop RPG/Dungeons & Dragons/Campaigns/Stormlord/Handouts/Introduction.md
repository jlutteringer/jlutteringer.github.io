# Stormlord
> One can't help but feel a sense of security walking the streets of this towering metropolis. Verns bears the mark of capital of the Republic, and one glance at its towering spires confirms the majesty of the greatest human empire to ever grace the realms. And yet the recent months have made clear what an illusion that security really was. The foundations of the Republic have been shattered, and it is now Verns that stands as man's last beacon of survival.

> A fierce, and truley alien race of creatures known now to the public as the Eldrazi have consumed the northern empire, leaving a trail of untold destruction in their wake. Forged by the divine in ages past, these creatures were lost to history, long believed to be mere legends of a more primitive era. Since their return, the greatest achivements of mankind have crumbled under their endless legions, and even the sacred home of the northern elves has been sacked.

> At their helm, a man named Les Stroud stalks the shadows, the engineer of the current cataclysm, he drives the nations of the Republic apart while relentlessly sieging them with his limitless alien legions. However, one ray of hope shines in the heart of the people: not a week prior, a brave group of heroes lead the combined armies of men to victory at Ahugin Breach, not more than a hundred miles north of the capital. These heroes not only spared Verns' people from the coming apocalypse, but imbued the streets of the city with a new fervor, a new hope.

> This, however, is not your story. No, we arrive at the close of another's tale, and the beginning of a new era. You feel the electricity, too, as you step out onto the city streets. The morning air is brisk, and although the day's chatter talks of victory, you sense imminent turmoil on the horizon. Fear hangs in the air like a disease, and you are certain that the coming days will test even the most formidible souls.

## The World of Aurum
Our tale begins on the Western Continent of Aurum, a vibrant and civilized land that the ancient Elniah once called home. Today it forms the heart of a great human Republic, made up of an uneasy alliance of six independent states. The Pontar Valley dominates the eastern side of the continent, a land of fertile farmland and temperate climate with a natural ocean border. Other civilizations struggle outside of the Pontar, with several scattered, independent human and elven nations to it's north. West of the Pontar is a no-mans land. Hinterlands which seem to always strech further than even the most determined expiditions could travel. It is still unknown where a western ocean might contain the landmass or if there even is one.  
A land shaped by the divine, Aurum is rife with magic and ancient history. Remnants of a great civilization, who historians refer to as the Elniah, are scattered plentiful throughout the Pontar hiding ancient secrets and hinting at the greatness of an empire long past. That empire once struggled against an ancient evil, something more powerful than even the Divines which architected their kingdom. For centuries that evil has slumbered, lieing latent beneath the fabric of the world. It sometimes slips through, however, in the darkest corners of the world evil grows, plotting against the young human nations building their futures in the light.

## The Republic

It was the Kingdom of Orleans, under the wise leadership of King Radovid Heclair II which architected the infantile republic. As political tensions between the six independent nations rose, Orleans, allying itself with Redmont, put it's neighbors to the sword. So the federation of six independent states was brought by force, sealing the losers into a pact of cooperation which has presided over the Pontar for a decade and a half.  
While the sting of battle is still raw for many of the member states, this great experiment has undeniably been a success. The Orlesian Rose, a council of representatives from each state, ensures that all voices are heard and cooperation is fostered between it's members. It is Religion which serves as the major uniting force for the Republic tieing it's people togther under worship of the three major dieties of the Elniah - Lathandar, Helm, and Mielikki.

## Orleans

One of the greatest states in the Republic, Orleans is the union's backbone, servicing most of it's military and housing its government under the banner of the Orleasian Rose. King Radovid Heclair II still serves as the governor of both Orleans and it's capital, Verns.

### Verns

The capital of Orleans, a vibrant multiracial city that is one of the largest in the Pontar, perhaps rivaled only by Taris. The adventure of Stormlord begins here, in the humble Glass Half Full tavern.

### Ahugin Breach

Another large city in Orleans, Ahugin Breach straddles the mountain pass which bears its name. Heavily fortfied, the city effectively controls northern movement in and out of the state. With the recent Eldrazi siege, most of the city lies in rubble but, miraculously, the fortifications still stand, buying the Republic a much needed victory over the forces of evil.

## Avernus

Another large state in the Republic, Avernus is typically antagonistic towards Orleans and lead the opposition states during the Sundering War and Ontillian's Rebellion. The state dominates the far east of the Pontar and Taris, the region's capital, is one of the Republic's two large ports granting access to the Great Ocean. Because of this, Taris is strategically valuable in conntecting the northern and southern parts of the Republic togther via sea-based trade routes.

### Taris

The capital of Avernus, Taris is strategically valuable in conntecting the northern and southern parts of the Republic togther via sea-based trade routes.

## Factions

### The Republic
#### Orlesian Rose
The Orleasian Rose is the name given to the lawmaking body which governs the Republic. Each protectorate sends several representatives base on its size to govern and make laws for the nation. The members meet weekly in a large statehouse near the palace in Verns, cementing the Republic's government's close ties with the Orlesian crown.  
Ever since the Ontillian Rebellion, King Radovid Heclair II of Orleans has served as a wartime chancellor of the council, effectively rendering the appointed council's governing powers moot, as the wartime chancellor holds power to veto most decisions reached by the council.

#### Republic Legions
The Republic Legions is the name given to the Republic's primary fighing force. Mostly lead by Orlesian nobles or knights of Helm, the Legions both functions as a city watch in the capital as well as other Orleasian cities and a proper war fighting force.

#### Republic Marines
The Marines as an organization run the Republic's navy. They have a heavy presence around Seabide and the Alluvian Gulf region due to its trade promince and proximity to the large military port of Willhelm. 

#### Order of the Vigilant Eye
The Order of the Vigilant Eyes was formed well before the creation of the Republic. In fact, the origins of the Vigilant Eyes predate written history itself in the region. The Order's legend claims that it was formed to battle a powerful cosmic enemy in a time before the formation of Kingdoms and armies. It was in the battle that the avatar of Talos, the Stormlord was slain by a mortal warrior and the god's divine essence was trapped somewhere in the material plane.  

Many people, even those in the Order, acknowledge that these are merely tales designed to highlight the true purpose of the order - protecting mankind from the desctruction wrought by malicious outsiders. Since the formation of the Republic, the Order has taken a more active role in the military, often serving as officers in the Legions, or leading special task forces. Recently, there has been a schism within the Order, as its Elders push against the military involvement and try to keep the Order focused on its 'true' goals.

#### Cowled Wizards
Mostly made up of high ranking mages from the Mage Circle in Orleans, the Cowled Wizards were formed shortly after the creation of the Republic as the primary means to enforce the new regulations on arcane magics. During the Sundering war, arcane magic devastated infantry on both sides and, at the war's conclusion, the Orlesian Rose outlawed the practice of magic without an appropriate license.  

The Cowled Wizards have locations in most large cities, but are headquartered in Vern. Additionally, the magical prison of Spellhold sits in Antion, and is used to house magical deviants.  

After the Cowled Wizards's betrayl of the Republic at Spellhold and the subsequent destruction of the prison, the Cowled Wizards gradually faded into irrelevance. While the Repbulic's laws against magic were technically still on the books the state lacked the means of enforcement both in terms of funding and officials with the wearwithal to rebuild the organization after the deaths of most of it's senior leadership.

#### Blackwatch Mercenaries
The Blackwatch Mercenaries are the muscle behind the Cowled Wizards. Really nothing more than hired blades, the Blackwatch forces work jobs for the Cowled Wizards exclusively. Many of the initial members were part of the Republic Legions but lately the 
Blackwatch have been known to resort to more unscrupulous methods to get their mark.  

With the destruction of the Coweled Wizards, the Blackwatch have expanded their operations into a more diverse portfolio, essentially acting as an army-for-hire that is sold to the highest bidders.

### Shadow Thieves
The Shadow Thieves are one of the largest criminal organizations in the Realm. Little is known about the organization itself, but their reach extends to almost any city in the Republic. The Shadow Thieves tend to be more numerous along the coast, and have been known to operate captured Republic frigates for transporting operatives and running smuggling runs.  

Unlike common thieves and pirates, the Shadow Thieves prefer political espionage, information gathering, smuggling contraband, and targeted assassinations over outright theft and harassing the local populace. This has somewhat protected the organization from more aggressive attempts to crack down on organized crime by the Legions.  

With the Awakening of the Eldrazi, the Shadow Thieves suffered from a mysterious attack which targeted the ellusive guildmasters of the organization. After the attack and with much of its leadership dead, Victor Montague, a former guildmaster, took up leadership of the Shadow Thieves. Although Montague is a capable leader, the Shadow Thieves have seen much of the influence they once wielded slip from their grasp.

### The Cult of the Unseeing Eye

### The Branded
The Branded are a rebel organization based in the island city of Antion who oppose the Republic's presence there and want to see Antion status as an idependent city state returned. They are mostly natives to Antion, and believe that the citizens of Antion should be in control of their own desity.  

Members are typically initiated with a circular branding around the wrist - hence the name. The Branded are a carry over from and insurgent group with the same name that fought off Orlesian troops during the Sundering War and kept Antion independent until its close, when it was forced to submit to the Republic as part of the surrender of the Alluivan Gulf region. Since the surrender, many of the original Branded were imprisoned or executed, but it is rumored that their leader. Brant Eiseman, was one of the original freedom fighters and clashed openly with Orlesian soldiers.  

In the last 15 years, the Branded have worked to politically undermine the current Republic-appointed governor, and to disrupt Republic operations while attempting to avoid direct conflict with the Legion. Lately, however, they have been in open conflict with the Blackfist pirates who have taken defacto control of most of the city in an attempt to protect the general populace, and have been protesting the Republic's lack of protection. The populace generally views the Branded as protectors of the people, but reckless.

### The White Hand
Prior to the Sundering War, the White Hand was a secretive order of elite mages that were representative of some of the more powerful noble houses in Taris. The order was comitted to advancing the secrets of magic and humanity's magical ability by any means necessary, often resorting to reckless or even dangerous experiments. It is said that mages of the White Hand equal or even surpass the abilities of the Circle mages of Orleans.  

During the war and after, the White Hand was driven underground by the Republic's new spellcasting regulations and the White Hand became more involved in political intrigue and intelligence gathering. As a punisment for atrocities comitted in the Sundering War, few Avernian mages were granted licenses by the Coweled Wizards and, unable to live under a system controlled by Orlesian mages, the White Hand continued to practice magic in secret.  

While the Avernian government can't directly support the subersive actions taken by these mages, members of the White Hand enjoy significant popular support amongst the common man in Avernus, where popular opinion has it that magic is one of the greatest and most noble diciplines that can be undertaken by man.
