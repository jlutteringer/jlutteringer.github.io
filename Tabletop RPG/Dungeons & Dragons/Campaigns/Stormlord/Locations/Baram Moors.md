# Baram Moors
> The woods quickly gave way to gentle, rolling hills, and it wasn't long before the twisting grasses had swallowed the road entirely. The dense fog appeared next, coating the landscape in a pale mist. Before long, the land had turned to a thick soup, and your quick march had becoming mired in stinking mud which sucked at your boots. The moors were swamp, and certainly no place to call home. It suprises you how such uncivilized lands could exist so close to the jewel of Orleans.

## Outlying Areas
There are several noticable landmarks which surround the moors, and offer glimpses into it's history and current predicament.

### Anderhail
> Rotting fencing first broke through the mist, the homes which they guard next coming into view. You approached a small ring of clustered houses, most of them rotted from years of neglect. At the far end of the town, a stone town hall building rose out of the marsh, in considerably better condition perhaps due to the nature of its construction. It was still a small building like the rest of the homes here, but was marked by a singular tower at the entryway which rose two or three stories.

There are five houses plus the town hall here in the Anderhail city square, and with all of them more or less abandoned save the town hall. If the players explore any of these houses make a roll on the encounter table below.

* (15) Roaming Undead - Skeletons & Zombies
* (10) Cultists
* (30) Loot - Medium
* (10) Roll Twice

An old woman by the name of Jendris Matherson and her dog Roger still occupy the town hall, and is Anderhail's last remaining citizen. Originally, she was the wife of the engineer, Scott, who oversaw the construction of Spire Zizziax and is able to give the players some background on the town (general points detailed below). In general, she will be hospitable and offer the players a safe place to rest.

Anderhail Facts:
* Anderhail itself was created to support the hundred or so workers it took to construct the tower. It was a massive undertaking.
* The spire was constructed atop an Elniah ruin that predated the structure itself. It was said that Magister Zizziax was the first to gain access to the structure after many centuries of attempts by various wizards of the capital.
* Zizziax met his end at the hands of the Order of the Vigilant Eye almost fifty years ago, after being accused of practicing necromancy. After his death, the town quickly fell into disrepair, and the Spire itself was destroyed. Matherson's husband was killed in the Paladin's initial raid of the town. This was also the beginning to what she refers to as the "Undead Blight".
* There's an old quarry somewhere nearby that is still resource-rich. The curse which permeates the land has protected it from the interest of mining companies.
* There is another family that lives nearby, the Woodson's. She knows little about them, but they arrived only a year or so ago, retiring from a life in the capital.
* Recently, there has been some strange creature stalking the Moors. It moves like a wolf, but is much larger. She's only seen it from a distance.

### Anderhail Mausoleum
The intended ultimate resting place of Arch Magus Zizziax, the Anderhail Mausoleum is an impressive construction designed to house only the magus itself. The building is made of heavy marble and is set on a large ridge with rises out of the swamps. Up here, the ground is more sure-footed and the mist even starts to clear out to some degree. The structure is currently inhabited by a giant spider, Khalaxx, who has been using the the tomb as a lair. With a DC 12 perception check, players will notice the unusually large webbing stringing from the ornamented parapets - evidence of the mausoleum's current owner.

Entering the Mausoleum is not as straightforward as one might imagine. The heavy front doors are locked and can be opened with a DC 15 lockpicking check. The players run the risk of jamming the lock and sealing the doors permanetly if they aren't careful. Other options include forcing the door (DC 20 Athletics) or breaking in through the boarded windows (DC 16 Athletics). Finally, the second floor of the structure is open air, and an adventurere might be able to climb the side of the structure, and rappel down inside. Excessive noise when entering the hallowed resting place has a chance of awakening the long dead - animated skeletons of the workers who died laboring tho build this monument to death.

### Anderhail Cemetery
several trapped gravesites, several dug out gravesites, higher chance of cultists, undead

### The Quarry
Lair of the Eldrazi Prowler.

### Woodson Lodge
Eldrazi Prowler summoning location. For encounter rolls here, Eldrazi Prowler chance is raised to (20), Cultists is raised to (30), and all others reduced by 5. The Woodson's have been slain in an attempted summoning ritual by rogue cultists, an endeavour which birthed the Eldrazi Prowler which now stalks the land. The home itself in completely destroyed, as the back wall was destroyed when the prowler made it's escape. Death fills the room. The Woodson's bodies hang from the cieling, having been drained of their blood by cruel cuts to their necks. The floor is littered with bloodied footprints, three cultist bodies, and a large summoning circle painted in the blood of the home's now deceased residents.

Upon summoning the prowler, the Cultists lost control and the creature killed them, corrupted them with the Eldrazi Conscription, and then fled the home, destroying it in the process. If the players examine the bodies, a DC 12 medicine check can be made to determine that the cultists were strangled to death and a DC 15 medicine check reveals the pulsing Eldrazi ichor that was embedded in the corpses abdomen. If left alone, the cultists will rise in a day as Eldrazi Conscripts under control of the Eldrazi Prowler.

To any players attuned to the Eldrazi, the summoning circle will draw their attention and, if they enter it, they will experience a powerful vision of themselves of the Eldrazi Prime plane.

### The Overlook
Allows visibility of all the other locations...

## Spire Zizziax
> The stillness of the Moore broke abruptly to a loud crash of metal on stone in the distance. Only a few moments later the sound echoed again across the hills, forming a rythmic beacon which lead you deeper into this fetid domain.

> An impressive construction in its time, the great Spire Zizziax now stood only as a reminder to the inevitable onslaught of time and the fragility of man. Its once high reaching walls now comprised a field of decaying rubble, half buried in the muck of the swamp, which lay scattered about a central foundation that formed the base of the Unseeing Eye's encampment. It was here where workers toiled around a large siege ram in an attempty breach a massive stone threshold of peculiar construction, an entrance which no doubt lead into the cavernous undercrofts beneath the structure. This was, no doubt, the source of the cacophany of labor which echoed across the hills.

### Surface Entrance
The primary foundation is a 125ft x 125ft cube walled along the edges with crumbling foundation walls of varying heights. In some areas, the outer wall is easily passable and in others it can reach as high as 20ft. Inside the outer supporting wall, an extensive excavation effort has unearthed a large Elniah vault entrance which dominates the center. As typical of Elniah structures, the stonework is unusually machined and the doorway is nearly flush with the entrance. It is obvious that the stonework here is far beyond what even the most renwoned builders of the Republic are capable.

The cultists keep up a steady stream of slave labor who toil against this massive gate. Slave cots are located in a barred in closure at the eastern end of the encampment, directly opposite the the primary entrance at the western end. Various ramshackle tents and campfires circle the edges of the rest of the camp, no doubt housing for the various guards stationed here.

All in all, there are about 20 slaves, and usually around half of them are at work operating the large battering ram at the center of the excavation. In addition to Marik, the camp boasts a contingent of 10 Zealots and 15 cultists, who are rarely all accompanying the camp at one time.

If the players arrive on good terms with the cultists, Marik will apprise them of the situation. Informing them that they have had little luck breaching the main gate, and have sent out some scouting parties to locate an alternate entrance with similar success. He will task the players with finding entrance to the spire's chambers, so the cult can reenergize the ritual which was started in the lower levels.

### The Antechamber

### The Boneyard
4 bone piles which animate skeletons. They animate a new skeleton every time one dies. Piles must be destroyed to stop the spawning.
