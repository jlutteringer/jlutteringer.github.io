# Baram Moors
> The woods quickly gave way to gentle, rolling hills, and it wasn't long before the twisting grasses had swallowed the road entirely. The dense fog appeared next, coating the landscape in a pale mist. Before long, the land had turned to a thick soup, and your quick march had becoming mired in stinking mud which sucked at your boots. The moors were swamp, and certainly no place to call home. It suprises you how such uncivilized lands could exist so close to the jewel of Orleans.

## Spire Zizziax
> The stillness of the Moore broke abruptly to a loud crash of metal on stone in the distance. Only a few moments later the sound echoed again across the hills, forming a rythmic beacon which lead you deeper into this fetid domain.

> An impressive construction in its time, the great Spire Zizziax now stood only as a reminder to the inevitable onslaught of time and the fragility of man. Its once high reaching walls now comprised a field of decaying rubble, half buried in the muck of the swamp, which lay scattered about a central foundation that formed the base of the Unseeing Eye's encampment. It was here where workers toiled around a large siege ram in an attempty breach a massive stone threshold of peculiar construction, an entrance which no doubt lead into the cavernous undercrofts beneath the structure. This was, no doubt, the source of the cacophany of labor which echoed across the hills.

### Surface Entrance
The primary foundation is a 125ft x 125ft cube walled along the edges with crumbling foundation walls of varying heights. In some areas, the outer wall is easily passable and in others it can reach as high as 20ft. Inside the outer supporting wall, an extensive excavation effort has unearthed a large Elniah vault entrance which dominates the center. As typical of Elniah structures, the stonework is unusually machined and the doorway is nearly flush with the entrance. It is obvious that the stonework here is far beyond what even the most renwoned builders of the Republic are capable.

The cultists keep up a steady stream of slave labor who toil against this massive gate. Slave cots are located in a barred in closure at the eastern end of the encampment, directly opposite the the primary entrance at the western end. Various ramshackle tents and campfires circle the edges of the rest of the camp, no doubt housing for the various guards stationed here.

All in all, there are about 20 slaves, and usually around half of them are at work operating the large battering ram at the center of the excavation. In addition to Marik, the camp boasts a contingent of 10 Zealots and 15 cultists, who are rarely all accompanying the camp at one time.

If the players arrive on good terms with the cultists, Marik will apprise them of the situation. Informing them that they have had little luck breaching the main gate, and have sent out some scouting parties to locate an alternate entrance with similar success. He will task the players with finding entrance to the spire's chambers, so the cult can reenergize the ritual which was started in the lower levels.

### The Antechamber

### The Boneyard
4 bone piles which animate skeletons. They animate a new skeleton every time one dies. Piles must be destroyed to stop the spawning.
