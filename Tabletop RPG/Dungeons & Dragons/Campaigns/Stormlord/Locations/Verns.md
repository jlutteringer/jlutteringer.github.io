### Sewers - Glass Half Full

#### 1. Rift Entrance
> So there was an entrance after all. Somehow, the late owner of the Glass Half Full tavern, Saeman Havarain, had engineered an entrance into the sewers - convienelty located near the strange meeting place which our heroes had observed at the beginning on their journey and no doubt hidden by some kind of eldritch magic. Everything had come full circle now, the air primed for a final confrontation.

#### 2. Hermit's Hideway
> It is unlikely you would even learn the fate of the helpful guide, Lucas, and his dog but you came to find his camp abandoned and littered with useless refuse.

If the players search Lucas' camp, they will discover a small shining orb buried beneath the refuse with a DC 12 Investigation check. A DC 15 Arcana check will reveal it to be an Arcane Eye, a sophisticated scrying device. It is likely that whomever conjured they eye could see through it even now.
