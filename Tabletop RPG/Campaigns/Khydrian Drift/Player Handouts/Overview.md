# Khydrian Drift

## Introduction
Mankind forged his temple in steel, its spine rising skywards from the ashes to push the limits of human preminence. It was through this zealous worship of the machine that man proved his tenacity, forging a world of limitless potential from the the very nadir of desperation. We were the rulers of our reality; heirs to starlight threads of endless possibility. Perhaps our arrogance doomed us from the beginning - that worship of false gods which had so languidly bled its way into our every thought and every action. Yes, togther we transformed hands of man into hands of the divine, and in so doing created a kingdom to which we were no longer heirs.

Now I ride homebound, carried on the wings of stannic angels to both meet my fate and scar my banner across the annals of history. My name is Admiral Richard J. Hadrian. These are the closing days of the golden century - the year of the Eclipse 433, and the final hours of the age of man.
