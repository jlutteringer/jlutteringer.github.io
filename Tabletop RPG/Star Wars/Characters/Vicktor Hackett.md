"You look worried. It's uncharacteristic."

Vicktor Hackett's low, gravelly voice broke the silence between the pair. His words hung in the void that followed the statement, the low hum of the <SHIP NAME>'s hyperdrive engines failing to mask the awkwardness which followed. Estrus Auralian found her musings disrupted by her lover's words, though she failed to give an immediate response. Instead, she kept her focus on the star trails which sped by like bolts of lightning on a blackened sky. Meeting here in the ship's observation deck had become somewhat of a morning ritual for the pair, but today was different. Today was the culmination of all of their efforts.

"This is it, you know. Once we've negotiated Holmion Prime's surrender the Trade Federation will be split in two. It's only a matter of time before this damnable conflict will be over. Then - then maybe we can make a life for ourselves."

He spoke again, words of encouragement, she knew, but her focused slipped once more. Would a life even be possible after such bloodshed? She knew what he meant by those words, of course. Their newborn daugher, ignorant of her parents' trail, was worlds away. Safe on Coruscant with Estrus' family. Perhaps it was the seperation which caused such anxiety. Could her own senses be fooled? Even such as they were, honed by years of Jedi training?

"I don't know." Estrus finally broke her silence, turning away from the stars to face the solder who lounged in the corner. The woman's comments spurred Vicktor to attention and he leant forward, elbows balancing on his knees.

"What is there not to know? It's already happening. These negotiations are a simple formality. You, the ambassador, just need to make an appearance - that's it. Hell, Estrus, we should be celebrating and here you look like we're about to be shipped off to the front lines." Vicktor studied her as he spoke, piercing eyes locked on hers. Of course he knew. He knew something. She couldn't hide it from him.

"No." Estrus spoke the words almost reflexively and set her hand over his, reassuring him even as the fear welled in her own heart. "Something will happen. Something already has. We should warn the captain - tell him to turn the ship around."
